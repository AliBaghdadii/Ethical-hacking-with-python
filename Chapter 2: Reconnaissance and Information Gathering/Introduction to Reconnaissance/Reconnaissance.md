# Passive vs. active reconnaissance techniques

Reconnaissance techniques can be broadly categorized into two types:
passive and active.

## Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target
without directly interacting with it. This approach is less likely to be
detected by the target's security systems. Some common passive
reconnaissance techniques include:

1. WHOIS lookups: Querying WHOIS databases to obtain information
about domain registrations, IP address allocations, and network ranges.
2. DNS enumeration: Gathering information about DNS records,
including A, MX, NS, and TXT records.
3. Search engine research: Using search engines to find publicly
available information about the target organization, its employees, and
technologies used.
4. Social media analysis: Gathering information from social media
platforms about the organization and its employees.
5. Job postings analysis: Examining job postings to gain insights into
the technologies and systems used by the target organization.

## Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system
or network to gather information. This approach is more likely to be
detected but can provide more detailed and up-to-date information. Some
common active reconnaissance techniques include:

1. Network scanning: Scanning IP ranges to identify live hosts, open
ports, and services running on target systems.
2. OS fingerprinting: Determining the operating system and version
running on target systems.
3. Service enumeration: Identifying and gathering information about
services running on open ports.
4. Vulnerability scanning: Conducting automated scans to identify
known vulnerabilities in target systems.
5. Banner grabbing: Retrieving banners or version information from
services running on target systems.
